This is a Java springboot project that will
1. create a springboot web app with rest endpoint
2. secure that endpoint, require jwt token to access
3. create SwaggerUI for that endpoint
4. contains libraries for observability in the future
5. has configuration using h2 db for demo purpose, do not deploy for production.

The motivation is to create a simple, minimal project that can be compiled to start with. Even with AI or vibe-coding, the start is always buggy and time consuming.
